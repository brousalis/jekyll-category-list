# Jekyll category list

[Demo of the CSS](http://brousalis.github.com/jekyll-category-list)

## Usage

If you're using Jekyll, add the category_list.rb file to your _plugins directory. This will give you the helper `category_list`. In your views, you can use this function to print out a list of categories:

    {% category_list %}

Then copy or include the category_list.css styles into your project. The list looks something like this:

Where personal is the hover state. 

## Contributing

Feel free to send pull requests, steal the code, claim it as your own. I'd appreciate feedback on how I could improve the Ruby or CSS.
